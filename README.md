# WeightedIntervalScheduling
 Project Devoper: Zachary Himes
 
 # Description:  
 Given a CSV file with lists of jobs in the format of {Starttime, Endtime, Duration}, the program can comupute the best sequence of jobs with the most return of constant work hours. It outputs a nicely formatted list of the individual jobs and there correspoding information. 
 
 # User Manual:
 
 
 # Details of the Implementation:
 
 # Testing explanation:
 I have three CSV files attached, two of which are pulled directily from the power point slides. The third is a randomly generated job list that can be used for additional testing.  
 ### Job.csv's visual represenation is as follows:

As you can see the most profitable sequence of jobs based on weight is going to be Jobs {1, 3, 5} as labled on the diagram, which equates to a total weight of 9.

### job2.csv's visual represenation is as follows:

As you can see the most profitable sequence of jobs based on weight is going to be Jobs {3,7} as labled on the diagram, which equates to a total weight of 10.
